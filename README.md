# Python-Project-for-Data-Engineering
IBM Project
# Introduction
In this IBM project, I played the role of data engineer for an international economic research firm. The firm monitors stock prices, commodities, exchange rates, and inflation rates. Here my work entails extracting financial data from various sources, including websites, APIs, and files given by financial analysis businesses. After I gathered the data, I extracted the information relevant to your business and changed it according to its specifications. After the transformation is finished, the data is loaded into a database.
Tasks for the Project
This project will need you to:
APIs are used to collect data.
Web scraping may be used to gather information.
To process the files, first, download them.
File types such as CSV, XML, and JSON may be read.
Data can be extracted from the file formats listed above.
Data should be transformed.
Use the logging module that is already installed.
Data engineers can load the changed data by saving it in a ready-to-load format.
